**Hi! I'm Alessandra Marusi and I'm a Junior Web Developer. I've been into coding since I was a teen, but then life drove us apart. During quarantine we met again and it was just like the old times. Since then I've been coding non-stop, experimenting and always trying to bring something new to my code. **

**My Skills:**

- HTML, CSS, SASS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- MySQL
- Vue.Js, Bootstrap, Laravel

**Some of my projects**

- **[EduPrime](https://alessandramarusi.github.io/proj-html-vuejs/)** made with Vue.Js 

- **[WhatsApp Web](https://alessandramarusi.github.io/vue-boolzapp/)** made with Vue.Js 

- **[PlayStation Homepage](https://alessandramarusi.github.io/htmlcss-playstation/#)** made with basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript

- **[Spotify Web](https://alessandramarusi.github.io/html-css-spotifyweb/)** made with basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript

- More to come
